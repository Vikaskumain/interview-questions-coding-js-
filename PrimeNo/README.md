prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself without leaving a remainder.

Here are some key points about prime numbers:

Divisibility: A prime number is divisible only by 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., are prime numbers because they cannot be divided evenly by any other numbers.

Prime Factorization: Every whole number greater than 1 can be uniquely represented as a product of prime numbers. This representation is called prime factorization.

Properties: Prime numbers have several interesting properties, including:

They are the building blocks of natural numbers because every natural number greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes.
They have no proper divisors other than 1 and themselves.
They are infinite in number; there is no largest prime number.
Examples: Some examples of prime numbers include:

2 is the smallest prime number.
3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, etc., are prime numbers.
