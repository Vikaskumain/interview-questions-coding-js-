<h1>Write a function to check if two given strings are anagrams of each other. what is the differece between and how to write a code and explain with defination</h1>

01=>  The line const cleanStr = str => str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, '').toLowerCase(); defines a helper function cleanStr that removes non-alphabetic characters from a string and converts it to lowercase. Let's break down its components and understand why it's useful:

02=>    Arrow Function Syntax (str => ...): This is a concise way of defining a function in JavaScript. It's called an arrow function, and it's often used for short, one-liner functions like this.

03=>   str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, ''): This part uses the replace method on the input string str to remove any characters that are not alphabetic. Here's what each part of the regular expression /[^a-zA-Z]/g means:

04=>  [^a-zA-Z]: This matches any character that is not (^ symbol inside square brackets) a lowercase or uppercase letter (a-z and A-Z).
/g: This flag ensures that the replacement is done globally, meaning it replaces all occurrences of non-alphabetic characters in the string, not just the first one.
05=>   .toLowerCase(): After removing non-alphabetic characters, we convert the resulting string to lowercase using the toLowerCase method. This ensures that the comparison between strings is case-insensitive. For example, "Listen" and "silent" should be considered anagrams even though they have different cases.

By using this line to define the cleanStr helper function, we ensure that we have a clean, lowercase version of the input string, ready to be compared with another string to check for anagrams. It also makes the code more readable and concise by encapsulating this logic into a single reusable function.
